Managed execution process includes the following steps:
1. Choosing a compiler
	To use the CLR use language compilers that target the runtime.
	The CLR is a multilanguage execution environment.
	The language compiler will determine what features you can use and you design your code using those features.
	If your components are to be usable by components written in other languages then their exported types must expose only language features that are included in the Language Independence and Language Independent Components (CLS) (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k5532s8a(v=vs.110).aspx).
2. Compiling your code to MSIL
3. Compiling MSIL to native code
4. Running code
