Web Browser XSS Protection is not enabled, or is disabled by the configuration of the 'X-XSS-Protection' HTTP response header on the web server.

The X-XSS-Protection HTTP response header allows the web server to enable or disable the web browser's XSS protection mechanism.

The following values would attempt to enable it: 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
X-XSS-Protection: 1; report=http://www.example.com/xss

The following values would disable it:
X-XSS-Protection: 0

The X-XSS-Protection HTTP response header is currently supported on Internet Explorer, Chrome and Safari (WebKit).

Note that this alert is only raised if the response body could potentially contain an XSS payload (with a text-based content type, with a non-zero length).
