X-Frame-Options header expected in HTTP response to protect against clickjacking.

Most modern browsers support this header.

Ensure it's on all pages returned by your server.

X-Frame-Options header values:
1. DENY

If the X-FRAME-OPTIONS value contains the token DENY, browsers will prevent the page from rendering if it will be contained within a frame.

For instance, if http://shop.example.com/confirm.asp contains a DENY directive, that page will not render in a subframe, no matter where the parent frame is located.

2. SAMEORIGIN

If the value contains the token SAMEORIGIN, the browser will block rendering only if the origin of the top-level browsing-context is different than the origin of the content containing the X-FRAME-OPTIONS directive.

For instance, if http://shop.example.com/confirm.asp contains the X-FRAME-OPTIONS directive with the SAMEORIGIN token, the page may be framed by any page from the exact http://shop.example.com origin.

3. ALLOW-FROM origin

If the value contains the token ALLOW-FROM origin, the browser will block rendering only if the origin of the top-level browsing context is different than the origin value supplied with the Allow-From directive.

For instance, if http://shop.example.com/confirm.asp contains the X-FRAME-OPTIONS directive with the value Allow-From https://partner.affiliate.com, then the page may be framed only by pages from the https://partner.affiliate.com origin.
