0. WMI Basics
Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is a:
a. Local & Remote system management infrastructure
b. Present since Windows 98 and NT4
c. Can be used to:
	1. Obtain system information
	2. Execute commands
	3. Subscribe to events

1. WMI Architecture

2. WMI Query Language
SQL-like query language used to:
	a. Filter WMI Object instances
	b. Register event trigger
Query classes:
a. Instance queries
b. Event queries
c. Meta queries 

3. WMI Eventing
A WMI Event has three requirements:
	a. Filter - An action to trigger off of
	b. Consumer - An action to take upon triggering the filter
	c. Binding - Registers a Filter <-> Consumer

Local events run for the lifetime of host process, Permanent WMI events are persistent and run as SYSTEM.

WMI Event types:
A. Filter:
1. Intrinsic
	System classes used in every namespace
	Must be captured at a polling interval
	Possible to miss event firings
2. Extrinsic
	Non-system classes that fire immediately
	No chance of missing these
	Don't include much information

B. Consumer:
Action taken upon firing an event

Permanent WMI Events:
Event subscriptions persistent across reboots
Need Filter, Consumer, Binding

4. Remote WMI

A. DCOM
DCOM connections established on port 135
Not firewall friendly
WMI service winmgmt is running and listening on port 135

B. WinRM/PowerShell Remoting
SOAP protocol based on WSMan specification
Encrypted by default
Official remote management protocol in Windows 2012 r2+
Single management protocol- 5985(HTTP) or 5986(HTTPS)

5. WMI Malware history
2010 Stuxnet
2010 Ghost
2014 WMI Shell
2015 APT29

6. WMI Attacks
1. Reconnaissance
	HostOS information
	Files/directory listing
	Disk/volume listing
	Registry operations
	Running processes
	Service listing
	Event log
	Logged on accounts
	Mounted shares
	Installed patches
	Installed AV
2. VM/Sandbox detection
	Network Adapter manufacturer
	BIOS serial number
	Process containing vm tools
	Total Physical Memory < n GB
	Number of logical processors < count
3. Code execution and lateral movement
	Invoke-WmiMethod 
4. Persistence
5. Data storage
6. C2 communication

7. WMI Providers
A WMI query requests data from a provider(a dll) which knows how to ask the OS for data and return it in a properly formatted manner.
