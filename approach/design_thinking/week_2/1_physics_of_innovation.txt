Design tools/techniques:
1. Storytelling (Put the human beings and their experience front and center. Take the listener along on their journey.)
	Empathy in present, Vivid images about the future
Good quotes:
1. Chance favors only the prepared mind. -Louis Pasteur

Catalysts:
Acting without substantial capital investments/ corporate support catalysts are masters at leveraging existing resources to spark growth.

Analysis, prediction and rules usually work toachieve control to work in a stable environment where the process is geared for execution.
But these approaches backfire in case of innovation facing uncertainity.

Large organizations are designed to produce low variance results in an environment of predictability.

Pursuit of innovation is messy and inefficient.
Exploration is a high variance activity.

Why is innovating difficult in organizations?
1. Organizations love big ideas.
Reality check:
	a. If an oppurtunity is big and obvious, chances are someone has already seen it.
	b. Human beings are terrible at envisioning things that dont exist.
	c. If you insist on hoe runs chances are you wont be getting many singles/many home runs.
	d. Ratio of resources invested gets too far ahead of knowledge possessed, bad things happen.
2. They are obsessed with analysis.
	a. Use data from the past to make decisions about future when innovation is about using that same data to know how it will diverge from the trend.
3. Managers get trapped in the "growth gridlock".
	a. Building something new v/s. Using something that already exists.

A prepared mindset:
1. Learning Mindset
	A person's perspective on world and outlook on life.
2. Broad repertoire
3. Customer empathy
