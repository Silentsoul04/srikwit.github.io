Questions:
	1. Why has the way designers think become relevant to organizations? What makes them different?

General view of the creative process -> Moses myth
Innovation is a miracle; most of us just don't have it

Alternative view -> Convert innovation as a series of questions

1. What is?
Assess current reality 
(You can later have a data intensive approach)
This will help:
	1. Understand the scope of the problem
	2. Bring forth other needs not previously thought about
	3. Get an idea of what the stakeholders need to reduce risk
	4. You will have an overview of what a great solution looks like without having it.

2. What if?
What if anything was possible.
Think about possibilities to achieve your goal by coming up with ideas.
Ask questions, don't stop because of constraints
Combine your ideas into a concept
(Possibility driven approach)

3. What wows?
Making the tradeoff between what is possible and what can be to:
	Satisfy stakeholders with resources you have in a sustainable way
Try prototyping your solution
(Option focussed approach) (Generate a portfolio of solutions and use what work for the stakeholders)

4. What works?
Try a low fidelity prototype with actual users and obtain their feedback (have fast feedback cycles, lower experiment cost and fail early to succeed sooner and test for key trade-offs and assumptions early on)
Iterate this process till you get confidence that your idea is of value
(Iterative approach) (Perform experiment and use it's data)
(Human driven approach) (Focus on a qualitative and empathetic approach)
You can now decide to scale it
