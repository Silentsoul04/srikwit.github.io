Nice quotes:
1. There are two types of problems: Mysteries and puzzles
Puzzles => You have sufficient data
Mysteries => You don't have sufficient data and you have to interpret with what you have. Here's where designers come in (Glorifying designers? But who are designers exactly? Problem solvers in this contex.)

2. Skills that can't be outsourced or automated
Design thinking, Narrative/Story telling, Symphonic thinking, Pattern recognition, Multi-cultural, Multi-ligual, Multi-discipline skill, Empathy, Play (Laughter, Humor, Games), Meaning (Sense of purpose/significance)

3. We have good result deductions from our analytical approach. You can now use design thinking to find the best result in a given context.

4. Using design thinking, reduce inefficieny and ambiguity in the design process and provide more time for reflection and disagreement

5. There is a difference between knowing the synatx of a language v/s. using it.
